## My process

- Set Up my GitHub and learned how pages work
- Went through the course with Angela Yu on Udemy
- Started with basic HTML Code
- Added a CSS Stylesheet
- Included an images folder
- Rearranged the website using absolute and relative positioning, centering with text-align, and seperating sections with division tags
- Then styled color scheme and font scheme

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
= Basic and Intermediate CSS

### Continued development
- Recognized that I need practice with centering & positioning
- Loved messing with font and color schemes but I recognize that I see lots of room for improvement
